# NGO Patch Checker

A small, ethical toolkit prototype to help small NGOs and community organizations identify obvious configuration issues and basic exposure on their public-facing hosts.  
**Purpose:** show how small, low-cost checks can reduce basic attack surface for resource-constrained organizations.

**Important:** Do NOT run this against any systems you do not own or have explicit written permission to test. This project is for learning, simulation, and authorized assessments only.

## Quickstart
1. Populate `data/example_hosts.csv` with hostnames/IPs (see example).  
2. Run (development stub): `python src/main.py --hosts data/example_hosts.csv`  
3. See example output in `docs/impact_template.md`
